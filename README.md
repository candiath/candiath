# 👋 Hi, I'm Natán

I'm a backend developer experienced with **Node.js** and **Express**, building clean, scalable architectures, well-structured APIs, and working with both SQL and NoSQL databases.  

I like experimenting with new technologies, improving performance, and keeping things simple yet solid. This GitHub is also my personal lab — I use it to practice, test ideas, and even take technical notes from time to time.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js), TypeScript, SQL, C, Java  
- **Backend**: Express, Clean Architecture
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB (Mongoose)  
- **Infra**: Docker, Apache
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub (Issues, Projects, Drafts for notes)  
- **Frontend in progress**: HTML, CSS, React ⚛️  

---

## 📌 What I'm working on
- Building a **clinic management system** 🏥 with **Node.js, Express & MySQL**, applying **Clean Architecture**.  
- Practicing **unit testing with Jest**.  
- Learning **React** to become a more complete fullstack dev.  
- Using GitHub not just for code, but also as a **knowledge base** for notes and experiments.  

---

## 🧩 Principles & Patterns I apply
- **Clean Architecture** for scalable and maintainable projects  
- **SOLID principles**, especially **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** to reduce duplication and improve maintainability  
- **Repository Pattern** for decoupling persistence from domain logic  
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to model complex business domains  

---

## 🚀 Next goals
- Level up my **frontend skills** with React and PWAs.  
- Explore **GraphQL, Redis caching, and CI/CD pipelines**.  
- Deep dive into **API security** (XSS, CSRF, Helmet, rate limiting, etc.).  
- Learn more about **DDD** and Node.js internals (streams, worker threads, clusters).
